<unk> members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan <unk> -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` <unk> ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. <unk> <unk> -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from <unk> the budget deficit .
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ <unk> billion including interest over 10 years .
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David <unk> , executive director of the RTC .
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent <unk> , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .
<unk> other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift <unk> until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said .
The complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight .
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and <unk> from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's <unk> plan , and Rep. Charles <unk> -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC <unk> Board has been <unk> in not keeping Congress informed .
`` That <unk> leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of <unk> , '' he said .
`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk> on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
We 're about to see if advertising works .
<unk> on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk> a familiar message : <unk> on investing , the market 's just fine .
Their mission is to keep clients from <unk> the market , as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
This time around , they 're moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc. <unk> a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were <unk> out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when <unk> investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads <unk> Fidelity 's automated <unk> beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is <unk> For Your Call . ''
A Fidelity spokesman says the <unk> , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
We had to think about it ahead of time . ''
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
<unk> the headline `` <unk> , '' it <unk> , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began <unk> commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which <unk> would agree to air its last-minute <unk> .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary <unk> , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , <unk> particularly bullish .
<unk> just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. <unk> advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . ''
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on <unk> last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk> to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John <unk> , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and <unk> it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 <unk> . ''
With the market <unk> and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly <unk> their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to <unk> yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's <unk> , <unk> `` Where We <unk> '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` <unk> by <unk> . ''
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .
The market seems to be <unk> out ; we 're taking a <unk> attitude , '' says <unk> B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a <unk> of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market <unk> <unk> .
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .

<unk> , that game of the long haul , is the <unk> sport of the mean , and the mean <unk> law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago <unk> in the National League <unk> was held to just one in two games by the <unk> Oakland A 's , the <unk> that had been done <unk> similarly by the Los Angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk> .

In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of <unk> autumn , a lot of the <unk> up was done by the A 's <unk> , Terry <unk> .
He hit a <unk> pitch from <unk> <unk> into the <unk> stands in <unk> four to stretch his team 's lead from <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , where it stayed .
So what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in 130 <unk> games , and <unk> in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later <unk> .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk> away successes to <unk> the pain of past and , no doubt , future <unk> .
Mark <unk> , the big , <unk> Oakland first <unk> , had three hits in four at <unk> , two more than he 'd had in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> 6 through 9 , <unk> the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and <unk> four of its runs in a <unk> decision .

That he was the A 's <unk> <unk> during its American League campaign with a <unk> mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the <unk> , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his <unk> <unk> is <unk> , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who <unk> early <unk> to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in Sunday 's contest .
`` Every guy they put out there had a better <unk> than the guy before , '' <unk> Giant manager Roger Craig .

The <unk> to <unk> with here says that about three of four <unk> -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took <unk> Series leads went on to win it all .
That 's not an average to <unk> Giant <unk> .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the <unk> <unk> BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public <unk> than `` <unk> , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been <unk> over the proceedings , but they <unk> them in relative calm .

A few folks even showed up wearing <unk> bearing the colors and <unk> of both teams .
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love <unk> both .
The only thing I 'm <unk> for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento <unk> , at the <unk> before Sunday 's go .
The above represents a <unk> of either <unk> or <unk> .
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably <unk> from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
<unk> it to say that if this were a New York <unk> series , or one between the Chicago <unk> and White <unk> -LRB- <unk> , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk> .

In the opening game , besides <unk> and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> surgery .
He was <unk> <unk> -LRB- <unk> in game two -RRB- , moved a <unk> along in the A 's <unk> second <unk> , and <unk> for his team 's final <unk> .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk> .

The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and <unk> Williams , the Giants ' <unk> <unk> .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs <unk> in in the five games against the <unk> .
They went a collective <unk> here , with zero <unk> and <unk> .
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco <unk> coach <unk> Baker after game two .
`` I 'd rather see a <unk> <unk> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who 's cold . ''

The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` <unk> affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .
<unk> said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of <unk> 's major customers .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , <unk> , which sells automated <unk> machines and computerized cash <unk> , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes <unk> G. <unk> , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should <unk> affect the current quarter 's results , <unk> said .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , <unk> had profit of $ <unk> million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
Mr. <unk> said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ <unk> a share from $ <unk> a share .

For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started <unk> in the small hours .
By <unk> , the selling was at <unk> fever .
But as the day ended in a <unk> Wall <unk> rally , the City <unk> a <unk> of relief .
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district .
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a <unk> as to how widespread the fallout might be .
By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in .
And it left mixed signals for London .
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but <unk> 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in <unk> trading .
At Jefferies ' trading room on <unk> Circus , a <unk> circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
Right away , the <unk> outnumbered the <unk> , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at <unk> , off <unk> points , or 7 % .
`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. <unk> , a big , <unk> New York native who runs the <unk> office .
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it <unk> , seeking to avoid risk .
`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .
`` We tend to run a very tight book . ''
Jefferies spent most of its <unk> in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers .
`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & <unk> , B.A.T , <unk> -- are getting pretty well <unk> this morning , '' Mr. Smith said .
<unk> later , a <unk> `` sell '' order for Scottish & <unk> came in .
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the <unk> area to have a cigarette .
On the screens , only two <unk> blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said .
He targeted <unk> shares of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
The <unk> yellow figures showed the best price at <unk> pence , -LRB- $ <unk> -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out <unk> .
But the market <unk> a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said .
`` It 's very <unk> . ''
He temporarily abandoned his search for the <unk> shares .
By this time , it was <unk> a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith <unk> a call from a New York customer <unk> an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break .
`` <unk> dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a <unk> , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely <unk> poised ...

He was right .
By midday , the London market was in full retreat .
`` It 's falling like a <unk> , '' said <unk> <unk> , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
Only half the usual <unk> crowd gathered at the <unk> <unk> & <unk> wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .

At <unk> p.m. , the index hit its low , <unk> , off <unk> points .
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could <unk> the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon .
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % .

As <unk> p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- <unk> , Shearson traders and salesmen traded <unk> on how low the New York market would open .
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger <unk> and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- <unk> more than 60 points in the first few minutes .

Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' <unk> Shearson trader <unk> Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares .
`` This is panic buying ! ''
As the London market rallied , some <unk> whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public <unk> and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James <unk> -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an <unk> effort to <unk> his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
<unk> <unk> , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ''
Rep. <unk> <unk> off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ''
He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` <unk> room '' in the administration 's position .
Mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation .
But they cited the UAL and AMR <unk> as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
<unk> both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to <unk> efforts to push the legislation .
`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide .
The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might <unk> costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out .
Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the <unk> step of <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk> .
<unk> of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .
All the witnesses , both <unk> and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <unk> from <unk> in on airline profits at the expense of safe , <unk> service .
But several committee members <unk> , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .
One of the major concerns expressed by the <unk> was that large airlines would be prohibited from <unk> themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk> companies .
In a possible prelude to the <unk> of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said <unk> <unk> , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a <unk> of negotiations .
`` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said .
The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .
Currently , average pay for machinists is $ <unk> an hour , Boeing said .
Now in its 13th day , the strike has <unk> about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some <unk> .
With a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike .
After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund .
<unk> at Boeing continues with supervisors and other <unk> personnel <unk> the lines .
And at the company 's <unk> , <unk> , plant , about <unk> of the <unk> machinists still are working , Boeing said .
Under Kansas <unk> laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant <unk> , Wash. , plant .
Union officials could n't be reached for comment .
DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock .
DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm <unk> Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board .
DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ <unk> bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ <unk> million proposal <unk> .
A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $ <unk> .
Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .
The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary .
As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to <unk> <unk> Inc. , a unit of Canada 's <unk> Corp .
Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . ''
He called today 's announcement `` <unk> and <unk> '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another <unk> .
European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound .
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York exchanges opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping <unk> % .
In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % .
West German Economics Minister Helmut <unk> said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based on fundamentals .
The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . ''
Paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit .
Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , <unk> and Stockholm .
Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled .
Following is a breakdown of major market activity :
<unk> :
One of the <unk> declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy .
The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged <unk> % , a one-day record , <unk> out the summer 's gains .
The index closed at <unk> , down <unk> points .
By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the exchange .
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had <unk> memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake .
This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly .
`` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said <unk> <unk> , an investment adviser for the Bank in <unk> 's Frankfurt branch .
He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % .
After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal <unk> trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume .
`` The beginning was <unk> , '' said Nigel <unk> , a broker for <unk> AG .
`` It took <unk> of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . ''
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .
`` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors .
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , '' said <unk> <unk> , a senior trader for <unk> <unk> .
Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up <unk> shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting .
But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of <unk> on Sept. 8 .
Some of West Germany 's <unk> chips took some of the biggest hits .
A <unk> % drop for <unk> AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially <unk> for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in <unk> .
Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks -LRB- $ <unk> million -RRB- by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each .
Yet yesterday 's market <unk> Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to <unk> marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to <unk> to the standing price unless the market <unk> quickly .

The <unk> General Index ended down 5.4 % at <unk> , a drop of <unk> points from Friday .
`` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before , '' said <unk> <unk> , a partner in brokerage firm <unk> <unk> .
`` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in Paris . ''
Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in <unk> , ordering buys instead .
Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day .
When Wall Street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargains .
<unk> Morgan & Co. <unk> to a loss in the third quarter , while <unk> Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % .
<unk> Morgan & Co .
<unk> Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
The latest quarter 's loss <unk> $ <unk> a share .
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ <unk> million , or $ 1.25 a share .
George M. <unk> , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing . ''
Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. <unk> said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ <unk> .
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ <unk> million from $ <unk> million .
The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said .
Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been <unk> interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
Such loans to <unk> also remain classified as <unk> , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ <unk> million , reflecting higher <unk> and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
`` These increases were partly offset by lower <unk> '' income , the bank said .
<unk> expenses grew 16 % to $ <unk> million .
<unk> Corp .
<unk> Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations .
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , from $ <unk> million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of $ <unk> million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of <unk> Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The strong performance , however , <unk> with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of <unk> 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ <unk> million , or <unk> % of net loans and leases , from $ <unk> million , or <unk> % in the second quarter .
<unk> totaled $ <unk> million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter .
<unk> in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which <unk> said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . ''
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in <unk> 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze <unk> 's net interest margin in the Southeast to <unk> % from <unk> % a year earlier .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , <unk> jumped $ <unk> a share , to $ 51 .
Results were released after the market closed .
<unk> Texas National , formed from the <unk> of of the failed First <unk> Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ <unk> million to <unk> 's bottom line in the third quarter .
<unk> said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 .
<unk> raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the <unk> Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .
Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ <unk> million .
In the first nine months , <unk> 's net income climbed 65 % to $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , from $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , a year earlier .
Security Pacific Corp .
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
Net rose to $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , from $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , a year earlier .
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
These <unk> loans in effect replaced some <unk> assets such as <unk> loans , which were allowed to decrease .
As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
Security Pacific shares closed at $ <unk> , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading .
The earnings represent a <unk> % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an <unk> % return on equity .
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market .
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ <unk> million in the year-ago period .
<unk> loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago .
Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ <unk> million , because it added to its <unk> reserve the year before .
<unk> income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations .
<unk> expense grew only 4 % in the period .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , from $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for <unk> of the offer .
The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
LIN is asking McCaw to <unk> its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their <unk> businesses .
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is <unk> . ''
The LIN board said holders may be <unk> by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares .
McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said .
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could <unk> its private market value and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in five years . ''
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ <unk> , down $ 2.75 .
A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ <unk> offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . ''
In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low . ''
The letter was dated Oct. 6 .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed yesterday at $ <unk> , down 75 cents a share .
Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ <unk> , or $ <unk> million , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
Telerate has rejected the offer , which expires Nov. 3 .
The group includes <unk> Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore .
Among other issues , the group 's letter said it has `` concerns as to whether Dow Jones 's offer meets the <unk> requirements of procedural fairness . ''
A spokesman for Dow Jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones <unk> with their <unk> .
Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ 18 a share .
U.S. Trade <unk> <unk> Hills said the first <unk> panel set up under the <unk> `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific <unk> and <unk> violate the accord .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. <unk> companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
However , in <unk> , Canadian Trade Minister John <unk> said the <unk> panel accepted the `` <unk> of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to <unk> and manage these important <unk> . ''
<unk> about the <unk> <unk> in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ''
The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
Canada initially had an export <unk> that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought <unk> in British Columbia by commercial <unk> prior to export .
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the <unk> panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended , she said .
Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General <unk> on <unk> and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian <unk> restrictions violated GATT rules .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. wo n't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. <unk> firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch .
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .

The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties .
`` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said one official at a <unk> 10 bank .
`` That 's good news , because we all <unk> in this water . ''

What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently <unk> to handle another <unk> in prices .
No <unk> with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be <unk> to halt trading whenever panic conditions <unk> .
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours .
The <unk> is that an <unk> of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary <unk> of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from <unk> on itself .
But there is also the possibility that <unk> down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What happened Friday was the worst of all <unk> .
The futures exchanges followed their own <unk> circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
With <unk> else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At <unk> , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at <unk> , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though <unk> separate , have actually become so closely <unk> as to constitute one market effectively .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
<unk> circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for <unk> , less volatile executions .
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for <unk> trading or staying open .
Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a <unk> decline .
The need for <unk> last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that <unk> circuit breakers in all markets .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , <unk> the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .

The advertising industry is <unk> with rumors that Kentucky Fried <unk> will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency .
But the company declines to comment .

Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet <unk> <unk> ads .
His <unk> : <unk> radio spots that offer helpful <unk> .
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
The messages resemble the Business <unk> , a daily <unk> of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities .
New <unk> include Burt Hill <unk> <unk> Associates , a <unk> , Pa. , <unk> firm .
Its radio series features such spots as `` <unk> : <unk> <unk> for Urban <unk> '' and `` Building a <unk> to Park . ''
A harder sell , says John <unk> , the firm 's president , would `` <unk> from the profession . ''
<unk> have signed up to use the messages to promote <unk> , and <unk> Gas Co. is considering the <unk> to offer energy tips to consumers .
But such spots can be too soft .
`` There 's always a risk of lost messages , '' says John <unk> , chairman of <unk> Advertising USA , which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank .
`` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ''
<unk> <unk> <unk> In Environmental <unk>
<unk> 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
Big Bear <unk> Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute <unk> recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health <unk> and will include products like Murphy 's Oil <unk> and other <unk> <unk> .
But the chain is quickly <unk> the <unk> of such <unk> .
For example , it recommends <unk> <unk> <unk> and puts <unk> on its environmentally safe list .
That does n't <unk> Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A company spokesman questioned the <unk> of the list , noting that <unk> is present in all major <unk> <unk> .
In fact , <unk> Bros. confirms that its <unk> brand does contain <unk> <unk> , even though it is n't listed on the label for the <unk> version .
Thomas G. <unk> , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems .
`` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says .
`` And it 's important that we be accurate . ''
But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail .

She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune <unk> syndrome .

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a <unk> predictable result of pork-barrel politics .
Nevertheless , <unk> such as the National Association of Home <unk> -LRB- <unk> -RRB- continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a <unk> housing crisis -- reduced <unk> of homes for <unk> buyers , increased <unk> , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ''
There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
But the <unk> was created in <unk> out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the <unk> amendment .
Yet on matters close to , <unk> , home ...
`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , '' argues Mr. <unk> .
`` We 've taken more than our fair share .
I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ''
But <unk> support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the <unk> has backed a host of public programs .
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk> housing measures .
Moreover , explains one HUD official , the <unk> remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that <unk> in subsidized production .
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
It would like to <unk> the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the <unk> price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ <unk> ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA <unk> requirements and increase the availability of <unk> mortgages ; expand the <unk> Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- <unk> -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and <unk> ; and `` fully fund '' the <unk> Act , a $ <unk> million <unk> for the homeless .
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past , and inevitably are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or <unk> .
<unk> subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .
Though Mr. <unk> says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere <unk> of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
More important , housing programs run by HUD , the <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> in red ink .
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .
The federal government has had to pump in $ <unk> billion into the <unk> housing program since 1984 to keep the fund <unk> and the <unk> requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .
All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages .
In its <unk> produced publication `` Where Will Our <unk> <unk> ? '' the <unk> does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government . ''
It points to the <unk> impact of local government regulation , particularly <unk> and building fees , which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people .
But while the <unk> has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate <unk> controls .
The association , a majority of whose <unk> members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the National <unk> Union : `` It <unk> in two <unk> .
The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the <unk> amendment . ''
Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .
Two years ago when the <unk> <unk> for the $ 19 billion <unk> housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. <unk> .
As Mr. <unk> of the <unk> acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... .
The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ''
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy ; more money to <unk> that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies .
Is this what the home builders want ?

-LRB- <unk> related story : `` And <unk> to Make <unk> <unk> True '' -- WSJ Oct. 17 , 1989 .
In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on <unk> the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome .
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <unk> , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .
The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency .
But the process of <unk> the <unk> conference does n't require <unk> .
<unk> a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
French President <unk> Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in <unk> last June , but the move was <unk> because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
<unk> sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .
The latest <unk> in the equities markets <unk> me of the joke T. <unk> <unk> tells about the guy who was run over by the <unk> .
When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ''
And so it was on Gray Friday .
The grand <unk> of this <unk> would appear to have been excess leverage .
Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the <unk> -LRB- <unk> -RRB- .
The <unk> began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was <unk> .
Although the <unk> expects to <unk> together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending .
<unk> of other <unk> made up the <unk> , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , <unk> Federal Reserve <unk> ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .
As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .
What really <unk> the <unk> along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is <unk> up .
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly <unk> investments in the `` deal '' stocks are <unk> by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing .
<unk> stocks led the market down as they <unk> the heaviest losses .
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ <unk> , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close .
AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .
-LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB-
<unk> lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % .
A careful look <unk> that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday .
The <unk> prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks <unk> issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .
The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks .
The growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> <unk> or takeovers , such as <unk> International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a <unk> over the entire market for high-yield securities .
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio <unk> and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .
As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .
These are all market <unk> -LRB- putting aside the <unk> boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in .
Of course , Washington had n't been <unk> in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to <unk> in the leverage <unk> remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on Friday .
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators .
Is this a case where private markets are <unk> of Washington 's <unk> of Wall Street ?
<unk> not .
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the <unk> of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged <unk> .
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO <unk> become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with <unk> speed to impose appropriate sanctions .
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> , but they <unk> the <unk> up all year .
Not surprisingly , he sometimes <unk> .
The arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed on Gray Friday , while the <unk> managers of prospective targets <unk> <unk> .
If you identify with the <unk> managers , you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the <unk> of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .
Although the average <unk> is probably not <unk> too much from Washington 's <unk> war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial <unk> , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .
Any such attempt to <unk> `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to <unk> the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them <unk> that seem never to end .

Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising <unk> points to close the morning session at <unk> .
The index slid <unk> points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .
In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared <unk> points , to <unk> .
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up <unk> points , to <unk> as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally .
Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets .
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of <unk> another market crash .
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street .
But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines .
Still , despite the sudden <unk> of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities .
`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at <unk> Life Insurance Co .
`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ''
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure <unk> trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that .
But in the absence of <unk> trading , its presence was never <unk> felt .
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at <unk> , down <unk> points , or 1.8 % .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank <unk> , or 1.7 % , to <unk> .
The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions .
Declining issues <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
But volume was thin at <unk> million shares , compared with <unk> million Friday .
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes .
A <unk> rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low .
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell <unk> , or 2.7 % , to <unk> .
Many investors , trying to <unk> the market 's major indexes , have <unk> to these small issues in recent weeks .
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply .
But its performance did bear some <unk> to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .
Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's <unk> % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell <unk> % .
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead <unk> to Wall Street 's opening .
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged <unk> to close at <unk> on heavy volume of <unk> shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
<unk> <unk> , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan .
`` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said .
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ''
<unk> <unk> , general manager of the investment research department at <unk> Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` <unk> '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , '' he said .
`` Those shares which had posted gains on <unk> speculation were <unk> with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . ''
Other fund managers were similarly <unk> .
`` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said <unk> <unk> , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <unk> Trust & Banking Co .
He said Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that <unk> Trust plans for when it <unk> its overseas investment strategy .
Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the <unk> <unk> composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's <unk> Times Industrial Index down 10 % .
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
<unk> , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and <unk> escaped with slightly smaller losses .
Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market .
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said William <unk> <unk> , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- <unk> -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong .
`` Markets in this region are n't so <unk> to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . ''
Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China .
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with <unk> Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .
She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the <unk> Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who <unk> out generally did so <unk> .
Similarly , <unk> <unk> 's composite index yesterday ended <unk> % above its 1988 close .
In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell <unk> to finish at <unk> .
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with <unk> million Friday .
But the session was <unk> , in contrast to the market 's four-day <unk> after the 1987 crash .
Richard <unk> , a director at Hong <unk> <unk> International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
`` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said .
In Australia , Sydney 's All <unk> index closed at <unk> , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 .
But volume rose only to <unk> million shares from <unk> million Friday .
<unk> <unk> , an analyst at brokerage firm <unk> , <unk> & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` <unk> '' as investors fled to <unk> Australian stocks and <unk> <unk> companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price .
London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of <unk> , down <unk> , or 3.2 % .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points .
The Financial Times 30-share index closed <unk> points lower at <unk> .
Volume more than doubled to <unk> million shares from <unk> million Friday .
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of <unk> points , or <unk> % , to <unk> was the Frankfurt market 's <unk> fall ever .
<unk> investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % .
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline <unk> for the next three months .

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you <unk> the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California .
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's <unk> , but maybe the state 's <unk> <unk> are starting to <unk> the forces that made it such a significant place .
What else is one to make of the <unk> <unk> initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ?
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to <unk> the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too <unk> .
The initiative is based largely on the <unk> of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of <unk> <unk> , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National <unk> <unk> and the Citizens for a Better <unk> .
<unk> , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
In other words , California is <unk> to take control of the nation 's farm policy .
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is <unk> from scientific reality .
Consider the <unk> provision .
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is <unk> that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is <unk> as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
The key here is the <unk> of state Attorney General John Van de <unk> .
He 's running for governor .
Mr. Van de <unk> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .
That 's also the day of the <unk> election .
The initiative seems to have been <unk> to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood <unk> who <unk> money .
And it allows Mr. Van de <unk> to get around campaign spending limits .
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de <unk> initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is <unk> .
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big <unk> .
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. <unk> Wilson , is playing the initiative <unk> game too , <unk> his own crime initiative . -RRB-
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course <unk> that in modern California it could slide through .
This is the state that recently passed the <unk> 65 <unk> initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
That means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Mr. Van de <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a <unk> and <unk> issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of <unk> , <unk> <unk> can pass under its <unk> .
Of course the state 's <unk> are not yet a nation <unk> themselves .
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate <unk> to an attorney general from California .
And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
This <unk> initiative will help California <unk> itself for the future either as a state still <unk> to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to <unk> its <unk> activists want to take it .
First , there was a death watch .
Then <unk> .
<unk> by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and <unk> about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining <unk> to <unk> .
It was the <unk> advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on <unk> New York Stock Exchange volume of <unk> shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash .
While the advance <unk> investors who feared a <unk> crash would occur yesterday , it was <unk> a <unk> rally fed by huge buying by <unk> institutions and program traders .
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge .
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down <unk> to <unk> .
Meanwhile , in a <unk> in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the <unk> Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled <unk> to <unk> -- its <unk> decline next to the <unk> fall during the 1987 crash .
<unk> plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7/8 to <unk> 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .
Overall , `` this is a <unk> rally but it 's very <unk> , '' said Arthur <unk> Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general <unk> of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
It 's just a strange feeling .
I do n't think anyone left the place <unk> <unk> . ''
The rally gave <unk> , at least for now , to the <unk> declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an <unk> condition , and not a disaster . ''
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down <unk> shortly after 9:30 .
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's <unk> <unk> .
At <unk> , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow <unk> of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to <unk> .
The Dow dropped to a quick <unk> loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
More stocks opened over the <unk> half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market <unk> <unk> to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , <unk> stocks into <unk> losses .
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
This was a <unk> from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
The <unk> of the program selling <unk> any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
They did n't .
The Dow <unk> its slide , losing <unk> in the first 40 minutes of trading .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
Then at <unk> the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <unk> fall .
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
The program traders were in there , too , of course .
But according to one trader , the <unk> `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of <unk> '' by institutions .
<unk> M. <unk> , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning .
`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in '' the market .
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest <unk> imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day .
The stock opened late at 114 1/2 , down 8 1/2 .
But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .
However , Disney specialist Robert <unk> said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ''
<unk> Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock .
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader <unk> <unk> said : `` I think the opening was <unk> .
It was <unk> .
We put some orders together .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either <unk> or internationally ... .
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ''
Still , the market had n't yet <unk> into positive territory , and traders were <unk> .
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow <unk> on 42 points in five minutes , and at <unk> the index showed a gain of <unk> .
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders <unk> their approval .

Among Big Board specialists , the <unk> was `` <unk> your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was <unk> on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist .
But not everybody was making money .
The <unk> on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed , <unk> , '' said one Chicago-based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks <unk> the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .
James <unk> , a partner at specialist <unk> & <unk> , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` <unk> Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a <unk> to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a <unk> . ''
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <unk> Tuesday .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald <unk> , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's <unk> chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
<unk> were criticized for their inability to maintain <unk> markets during the Friday plunge .
But yesterday , even with <unk> in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the <unk> -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. <unk> , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading <unk> in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and <unk> Energy .
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been <unk> during the past two days ' gyrations .
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
For example , <unk> jumped 3 1/4 to 38 , <unk> rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22 .
Because of the UAL and AMR <unk> , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares .
Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares .
Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years .
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .

Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to <unk> on nearly 1.6 million shares .
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for <unk> Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months .
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were <unk> , he said .
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say <unk> the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said .
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
`` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said .
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants <unk> very , very <unk> today . ''
Meanwhile , Peter <unk> , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors .
`` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. <unk> said in an interview .
`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 .
They used their judgment .
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market <unk> .
Maybe they learned from experience . ''
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was <unk> , because out of <unk> Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close .
`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said of the specialists .
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading <unk> .

A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the <unk> U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a <unk> <unk> for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
By a <unk> margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .
But the <unk> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank <unk> -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to <unk> votes for the initiative .
The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. <unk> 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is <unk> with more than $ <unk> million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver .
From the <unk> , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina .
Majority <unk> William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of <unk> lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more <unk> , but politically important , projects of members .
In a <unk> lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .

`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ''
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ <unk> billion -- a 12 % boost .
The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental .
<unk> of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver .
Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the <unk> .
But this was rejected in favor of much <unk> language <unk> the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ <unk> million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of <unk> airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
Congress previously cut six airports this year .
The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies .

The Poles might do better to view it as a <unk> <unk> .
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative <unk> as the <unk> page , <unk> reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States .
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people .

The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
Traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .

Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .

`` The <unk> is <unk> back to black and white , '' says Richard <unk> , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional <unk> division .
Until two years ago , sales of <unk> film had been declining steadily since the 1960s .
But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year .
<unk> companies are scrambling to tap the <unk> market , <unk> some <unk> product lines and developing new ones .
At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , <unk> film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company 's $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing <unk> <unk> , one of the <unk> and most sensitive <unk> films .

Sales of <unk> 's four <unk> of <unk> film this year are <unk> growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much .
`` We hope the trend lasts , '' says <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's marketing communications director .

Consider <unk> Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features <unk> shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known <unk> <unk> the retailer 's jeans and <unk> .
Richard <unk> , the account manager for the campaign , says <unk> did n't <unk> choose black and white to <unk> its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
The campaign won a <unk> award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and <unk> , which have long <unk> on color , are making the switch .
Companies `` feel black and white will <unk> a stronger statement , '' says <unk> L. <unk> , a Chicago <unk> who is working on a <unk> print ad for <unk> Food Corp. 's <unk> <unk> .

Still , most consumers are n't <unk> <unk> film into their cameras to take family <unk> .
One big obstacle is that few <unk> develop the film anymore .
Typically , it must be <unk> to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
<unk> film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
But for <unk> , developing costs for <unk> film are higher .
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
<unk> , for example , recently introduced a <unk> film that can be processed quickly by color labs .

`` It seems computers as <unk> have <unk> , '' says <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's chairman and chief executive officer .
But some industry observers believe the <unk> of black and white is only a <unk> .
They cite the <unk> of still electronic <unk> , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and <unk> improvements in the quality of color <unk> .
`` Black and white has n't made the same <unk> <unk> in technological development as color , '' says Mr. <unk> of the Rochester Institute .
`` The color print today is far superior to <unk> of 10 years ago .
You ca n't say the same with black and white . ''
But when Popular <unk> , a leading magazine for <unk> , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue <unk> <unk> 's <unk> anniversary , all were black and white .

Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .
<unk> Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets .
While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a <unk> indicator that has <unk> <unk> the economy 's <unk> and <unk> by <unk> long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business <unk> Research here , reached a record high of <unk> in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
The latest reading of <unk> was up from <unk> in July and <unk> as recently as March .
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .
In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .
Its <unk> behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some <unk> to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end .
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says <unk> H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .
A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business <unk> <unk> Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when <unk> and recessions begin and end .
The group normally <unk> only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely .
`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports .
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts <unk> <unk> economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
<unk> this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or <unk> , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators .
Over the full <unk> War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the <unk> of recessions and turned up eight months before <unk> .
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far <unk> -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before <unk> .
The Columbia economists also have <unk> how the long leading index would have <unk> , had it existed , in <unk> , before the stock market crash in October that <unk> in the Great <unk> .
The indicator reached a peak in January <unk> and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says .
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate <unk> index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market <unk> .
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the <unk> version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new <unk> permits .
<unk> <unk> from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's <unk> prospects , though it still is useful for <unk> some <unk> <unk> and turns . ''
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .
It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .
The stock market has lost some <unk> power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .
`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the <unk> balance and inflows of foreign capital .
He also feels that the rise of such <unk> practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's <unk> to the economic outlook .

Chicago investor William <unk> agreed to sell three divisions of <unk> Peabody & Co. for about $ 600 million to <unk> S.A. , a closely held clothing maker based in Paris .
Shortly after completing the $ <unk> billion acquisition of West <unk> Inc. in April , Mr. <unk> 's holding company , <unk> Inc. , said it was considering the sale of <unk> , a leading <unk> maker and one of West <unk> 's biggest units .
<unk> in the sale are <unk> units that make men 's <unk> under the <unk> name , <unk> under the Gold <unk> name and <unk> through the <unk> division .
The companies said the agreement is subject to <unk> 's <unk> of financing and to regulatory and other approvals .
They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November .
Mr. <unk> said the sale of three of <unk> 's four main divisions plus other `` anticipated '' West <unk> asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million .
He did n't elaborate on other asset sales being considered .
Mr. <unk> followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets .
But he kept <unk> of the <unk> Inc. , the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive .
<unk> was an independent company until West <unk> acquired it for $ 375 million in cash and stock in 1986 .
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , 1988 , <unk> had operating profit of $ 37 million on sales of $ <unk> million .

Britain 's Blue <unk> PLC intends to change its name to <unk> PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk> <unk> Inc .
Blue <unk> Chairman Mitchell <unk> said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk> the world 's biggest <unk> group in the U.S. .
Mr. <unk> disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue <unk> posted a 2.5 % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings .
The name change and good will write-off could help <unk> Blue <unk> 's <unk> of the U.S. <unk> market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge .
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue <unk> compared with 9 % last January .
`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the <unk> name is <unk> stronger than Blue <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> said .
The moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of Blue <unk> as a company in turmoil .
`` It further <unk> the concept that Blue <unk> is a thing of the past , '' said <unk> Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York .
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added .
In a widely publicized <unk> coup , Mr. <unk> ousted <unk> Berry as Blue <unk> chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. <unk> out as the $ 1 <unk> chief of <unk> <unk> .
Mr. <unk> <unk> his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .
But the Blue <unk> <unk> is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -LRB- $ <unk> million -RRB- loan which Mr. <unk> has said was made under Mr. Berry 's direction .
Blue <unk> was able to pull off the $ <unk> billion takeover of <unk> in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
Under British rules , Blue <unk> was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will <unk> from the purchase .
As a <unk> company , Blue <unk> would have to <unk> the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue <unk> reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from <unk> 's <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> said .
The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ''
Mr. <unk> said he hopes to <unk> some of the good will left on Blue <unk> 's U.S. books in one fell <unk> , but would n't specify how much .
People close to Blue <unk> suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management <unk> the extent of <unk> 's good will .
That move , along with the return to the <unk> name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after <unk> nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur .
Blue <unk> blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in Britain .
Overall , pretax profit slid to # <unk> million in the quarter from # <unk> million a year earlier .
Richard G. <unk> , the man credited with <unk> Applied Power Inc. from an <unk> into a <unk> player in the global market for <unk> tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp .
The <unk> former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time .
But analysts , while <unk> the acquisition , say Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in <unk> the two companies .
Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ <unk> million , makes <unk> equipment and <unk> systems .
The <unk> , Mass. , company 's sales have been <unk> and its profits have dropped .
Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ <unk> from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million .
Besides <unk> Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ <unk> million in 1988 , Mr. <unk> must <unk> its costs and product line .
`` The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , '' says F. John <unk> , an analyst at <unk> Ellis <unk> in <unk> .
The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. <unk> .
The <unk> , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ <unk> a share in August 1987 , and Mr. <unk> 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 .
The stock has since <unk> , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ <unk> in national over-the-counter trading .
But Mr. <unk> has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of
<unk> that goal , says Robert T. <unk> , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient <unk> '' of cash by Applied and <unk> of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .
In Barry Wright , Mr. <unk> sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .
Applied , then a closely held company , was <unk> under the management of its controlling family .
While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a <unk> return on invested capital , '' he says .
Mr. <unk> is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied .
He also <unk> an `` <unk> '' <unk> to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where <unk> is shared .
Mr. <unk> considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors .
`` With a little <unk> , these businesses will perform very <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> says .
Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts .
Mr. <unk> figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat .
When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , '' he says .
He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .
At Applied , Mr. <unk> set growth as his first objective .
He took the company public in an offering that <unk> Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program .
Sales climbed to an estimated $ <unk> million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ <unk> million in fiscal 1985 .
The company expects that earnings , which have <unk> steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ <unk> million , or $ <unk> a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ <unk> million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 .
