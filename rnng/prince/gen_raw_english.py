Computational linguistics
---------------------

Task driven or goal directed semantic parsing :
    - Question answering or dialogue related task chatbots
          Ongoing Q/A for English/French from Wikidata
       	       => multilingual perspective
	       => Written text
          (Staff) Crabbé, Candito, Amsili
	  (next year) working prototype system for French
	  (perspectives) extension to Q/A from raw wikipedia.
	  
Parsing for cognitive modelling :
	(*) Generative parsers and neural language models able to output metrics of interest for cognitive analysis (surprisal, entropy etc.) and analysis of behavorial and/or neural signal
	(Staff) Crabbé                               (with partnerships outside LLF)
	(already) RNNG parser (English, French) for written text
	(next year) multilingual RNNG parser for morphologically rich and freer word order languages
	(perspectives longer term) parsing speech; connecting with goal directed parsing
