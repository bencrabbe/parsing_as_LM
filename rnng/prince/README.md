The originals (found on INRIA mybox) texts where:
   
   * Le_petit_prince.u8.lemma (french) : there are some issues with
     segmentation such as '_' replaced by ' ' and sometimes punct
     attached to word such as : Laisse -moi faire un pas tout seul.
     (last dot)

   * little-prince-english-stanford.txt (english) 

The generated texts are :

    * prince_fr.raw
    * prince_en.raw


Sentence segmentation is tricky (esp. in French) would be useful to proofread manually.
